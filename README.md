### Review of Tasks




#### Here are the steps taken to achieve this complete this week's homework project:

* Built initial file system structure and deployed basic blueprint to Github to complete repository construction.
* Sketched out pseudo code logic and transcribed them into the code as comments.
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

*After multiple trial and error debugging sessions, all applied logic appears sound and no bugs can be generated from purposeful negligent entries.  From this point, it was time to clean up:*

* Refactor reduntant and worthless code.
* Removed multiple, annoying console.log commands used for debugging.
* Double-checked to ensured code was properly formatted and commented before submission.
* Used code validation service.
* Wrote README.MD file.
* Added screenshots to README.
